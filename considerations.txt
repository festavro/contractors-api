Some considerations about the test:
Due to the 48h deadline to delivery the test, I did not have much time to focus on the solution (Due to work and personal commitments)

Some problems I faced because of lack of time:

1 - I had some issues on using agregate functions with sequelize, that's why in the "best-clients" route I used a query in SQL to solve
2 - I Started developing a first unit test, but it is not functional yet. I'll try to save some time to focus on it on the upcoming days


What would I have done with more time:
1 - Solve the best-clients problem using sequelize models instead of SQL Query
2 - Include code coverage with mocha c8
3 - Cover all cases in the unit tests
